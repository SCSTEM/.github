# ‚öôÔ∏è Hello, world! üí°

Welcome to the South Central STEM Collective's GitHub. Most of the projects you will find here are for internal use, but feel free to use them as inspiration for your own projects or help us fix our mistakes with a Pull Request! 

## Who are we?

I will leave the in-depth explination up to [our website](https://scstem.org), but in short: we are a collection of volunteers, students, industry professionals, thinkers, dreamers, and Pennsylvanians passionate about STEM. Otherwise known as SC2, our group was born out of the need to host and support high-school robotics teams in our area, but we are hoping to achieve so much more.
